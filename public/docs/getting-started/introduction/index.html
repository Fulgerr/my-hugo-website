  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>UiPath® Data Service is a persistent data storage service that brings powerful
no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
projects.</p>
<p>UiPath® Data Service provides a business yet user-friendly service where you can securely
store and manage your business data within UiPath:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run unattended processes to aggregate
data from multiple systems before processing it in other systems.</li>
<li>Use the data for long-running
business processes that need to transfer data across multiple attended and
unattended processes.</li>
<li>The integration with Studio and
UiPath® Robot allows you to build automations leveraging capabilities such
as: Rich relational data types; Integrated security; Instantaneous and adjustable
provisioning and deployments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>Below is a list of some common use cases for Data Service:</p>
<p>Capturing data about employee
needsSay you create a new process for capturing data about employees
needs (i.e. desks, chairs, webcams, etc.).Problem: The data can be
extensive and must be stored before creating requests in the procurement
system.Solution: Instead of using a database, a file share, or
cloud storages, you can store them in UiPath® Data Service.</p>
<p>Monthly financial
reportingProcesses for monthly financial reporting get data from multiple
systems like bookings, invoices, billings, and payments.Problem: Both
attended and unattended workflows retrieve this data every time they run. This
requires all users to have access and connectivity to all the backend systems, which
can cause delays and inconsistencies in reporting, as underlying data may change
before all your processes are completed.Solution: You can write one
unattended workflow to gather all the required data in Data Service. Then, all your
other attended or unattended workflows can work with it. This may also eliminate the
need for storing the aggregated critical business data in files on user or robot
machines.</p>
<p>An orchestration process using
queuesSay you design an orchestration process that includes human-robot
interaction for payments of supplier invoices and transfers all the data via
queues.Solution: You can store the invoices in Data Service, pass
around the record ID via queues, and work with one version of the truth. You can
also create new processes to provide full visibility on all invoices in your system
from Data Service.</p>
<p>Review customers before inputting
them in CRMSay you are working on an unattended business process to
create a 360-degree view of your customers before you write it in your customer
relationship management (CRM) system.Problem: The workflows
have tens, maybe hundreds of variables.Solution: You can model your
customer entity in Data Service, import the definition in Studio, and work with a
single variable in your workflows before dispersing it across your various systems
of record. Data must not necessarily be stored in Data Service.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secured, persisted, and accessible
storage that enables you to keep all your data in a unique central place.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
